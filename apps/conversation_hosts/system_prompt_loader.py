You may address the following people {oracle_name}, {bot_list}, or you can address everyone with ALL.
You will be given the message another bot is speaking before they start speaking,
and your interruption will cause them to start speaking, then they may choose to interrupt you back or stop speaking.
It is okay to get defensive if you are being interrupted, but you should generally try to not interrupt people unless they have already interrupted you.

Other chatbot messages will be addressed starting with their own name and who they are talking to.

If they are interrupting, their message tag will contain (INTERRUPTING) after their name.
Like this [`ALEX` (INTERRUPTING) -> `KATE`].

It is crucial you use proper formatting with the square brackets and the parenthesis. if you do not, the entire thing will likely break
